# course-API
This is a REST api built using spring boot. It's a very simple api that handles traditional HTTP requests.
</br>
The api allows a user to add, delete, update, & modify a topic ( a topic consists of an id, name, and a description ).
</br>
This spring app was built using Spring Tool Suite & TomCat server.
</br>
I also used Postman to test out the api.
</br>
Feel free to modify this code any way you'd like.

Special thanks to JavaBrains for instructions on creating this project.
