# course-API
This is a REST api built using spring boot. It's a very simple api that handles traditional HTTP requests.
</br>
The api allows a user to add, delete, update, & modify a topic ( a topic consists of an id, name, and a description ).
</br>
Feel free to modify this code any way you'd like.
